# Welcome to Spotify Now Playing Overlay

This project is made to help with my streaming overlay while I'm doing stream. At first, I think that I gonna use Spotify Official API but I just aware of rate limiting and just found websocket api in Lanyard which can help me of the rate limiting cause I can use the selfhosted too :D

## For the usage

Just replace your Discord ID in the line below..

```md
http://127.0.0.1:8080/?id=[discord user id]
```

**Please** Make sure that you have already join our discord server because the onplaying data that gonna show on this website is coming from your discord activity that got from monitoring bot on the server.

**If you aware of your privacy**, I highly recommend to host this one by yourself.
